### Mathematics behind the (POW in Bitcoin)
Bitcoin mining never end up: each 4 years the mining result halved. 
- So the equation is = **-1 / 12**
- The infinite life time cycle of work and never finish.
- **8/π^4≈0, 1/12, 5/61, 6/73,** ... (simple continued fraction convergent sequence)

#### Similar equations:
- ≈ -**0.0833333**
- ≈ -**(833333 / 10000000)**
- ≈ -**(10Pi / 377)**
- ≈ -**(1 / 12)**

### In Euclidean mathematics: 
This equation means that every 4-year period, the radius of the circle is added to the previous diameter.\
That is, circle radius + circle diameter is equal to the new circle. (tao **τ** = 2pi **2π**)\
The distance between you and the destination increases.\
In the second dimension, the third dimension of this equation is different.

### In linear algebra: 
In each 4-year period, you travel half the distance of the previous period.\
A line by width *21.000.000* each period half of the distance.

#### Simple equetion
Point of View: satoshies * 0.5 ^ n = 0\
Build a loop and compute the cycles,\
each cycle * 4 = how many years.\
n represnting the cycles.

- 21000000 * (1/2)^(n) = 0

P.S: remember to calculate Satoshies (0.00000001 BTC)\
1 BTC = 1000000000 satoshi

#### Logic of Equetion
To solve this equation for 'n', we can use logarithms.\
First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by dividing both sides by '210000' (210000 is short hand number for present 21Million):\
`0.5^n = 0/210000` 

'0/210000' is equal to '0' **:) !**, so we can rewrite the equation as:\
`0.5^n = 0` 

Now we can take the logarithm base '0.5' of both sides:\
`log_0.5(0.5^n) = log_0.5(0)` 

The right side of the equation is undefined, so the equation has no solution.\
Therefore, there is no value of n for which `210000 * 0.5 ^ n = 0`.
