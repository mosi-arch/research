### Mathematics behind the (POW in Bitcoin)
Bitcoin mining never end up: each 4 years the mining result halved. 
- So the equation is = **-1 / 12**
- The infinite life time cycle of work and never finish.
- **8/π^4≈0, 1/12, 5/61, 6/73,** ... (simple continued fraction convergent sequence)

#### Similar equations:
- ≈ -**0.0833333**
- ≈ -**(833333 / 10000000)**
- ≈ -**(10Pi / 377)**
- ≈ -**(1 / 12)**

### In Euclidean mathematics: 
This equation means that every 4-year period, the radius of the circle is added to the previous diameter.\
That is, circle radius + circle diameter is equal to the new circle. (tao **τ** = 2pi **2π**)\
The distance between you and the destination increases.\
In the second dimension, the third dimension of this equation is different.

### In linear algebra: 
In each 4-year period, you travel half the distance of the previous period.\
A line by width *21.000.000* each period half of the distance.

#### Simple equetion
n = how many years\
21000000 * (1/2)^(n) = 0
