### Mathematics behind the (POW in Bitcoin)
Bitcoin mining never end up: each 4 years the mining result halved. 
- So the equation is = -1 / 12
- The infinite life time cycle of work and never finish.
- 8/π^4≈0, 1/12, 5/61, 6/73, ... (simple continued fraction convergent sequence)

#### Similar equations:
- ≈ -0.0833333
- ≈ -(833333 / 10000000)
- ≈ -(10Pi / 377)
- ≈ -(1 / 12)
