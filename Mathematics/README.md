### Mathematics behind the (POW in Bitcoin)
Bitcoin mining never end up: each 4 years the mining result halved. 
- So the equation is = **-1 / 12**
- The infinite life time cycle of work and never finish.
- **8/π^4≈0, 1/12, 5/61, 6/73,** ... (simple continued fraction convergent sequence)

#### Similar equations:
- ≈ -**0.0833333**
- ≈ -**(833333 / 10000000)**
- ≈ -**(10Pi / 377)**
- ≈ -**(1 / 12)**

### In Euclidean mathematics: 
This equation means that every 4-year period, the radius of the circle is added to the previous diameter.\
That is, pi plus tao is equal to the new circle. The distance between you and the destination increases.\
In the second dimension, the third dimension of this equation is different.

### In linear algebra: 
In each 4-year period, you travel half the distance of the previous period.\
A line by width *21.000.000* each period half of the distance.
