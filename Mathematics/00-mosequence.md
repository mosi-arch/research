### what is mosequencs?
this is the numbers between **'0'** to **'1500'** when you calculate in '**binary length**'.

#

#### the python code

```py
def bitLength(number):
    count = 0
    while ((1 << count) <= number):
        count += 1
    return count

def showBitLength():
    shape = []
    for i in range(1501): # range 0 to 1500
        shape.append(bitLength(i))

    print(shape)

showBitLength()
```
