### Solution algorithm for transferring a document anonymously using zero-knowledge proofs:

1. Encrypt the document using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES-256. This ensures that the contents of the document are protected during transmission.

2. Generate a random value, r, using a cryptographic random number generator. This value will be used to create a zero-knowledge proof.

3. Compute the hash value of the document, H(d), using a secure hash function such as SHA-256. This hash value will be used as the basis for the zero-knowledge proof.

4. Compute a commitment value, C, as follows: C = g^r * H(d)^s, where g is a generator of a cyclic group, and s is a secret value known only to the sender.

5. Send the recipient the commitment value, C, along with the encrypted document.

6. The recipient generates a random value, x, and sends it to the sender.

7. The sender computes a response value, y, as follows: y = r + s*x.

8. The sender sends the response value, y, to the recipient.

9. The recipient verifies the zero-knowledge proof by checking that g^y = C * (H(d)^x).

10. If the zero-knowledge proof is valid, the recipient can be sure that the sender knows the secret value s without revealing it, and therefore the sender must have access to the document. The recipient can then decrypt the document using the shared secret key.

### Mathematics Formula:

Let(variable) d be the document to be transferred, H(d) be its hash value, and E(k, d) be the result of encrypting d with a symmetric encryption algorithm using key k. Let g be a generator of a cyclic group, and let s be a secret value known only to the sender.
> â—¼ 'let' in mathematics same as 'variable' in programming

1. Sender: Choose a random value r and compute the commitment value C as:
```
C = g^r * (H(d))^s
```

2. Sender: Send C and E(k, d) to the recipient.

3. Recipient: Choose a random value x and send it to the sender.

4. Sender: Compute the response value y as:
```
y = r + s*x
```

5. Sender: Send y to the recipient.

6. Recipient: Verify the zero-knowledge proof by checking that:
```
g^y = C * (H(d))^x
```

7. Recipient: If the zero-knowledge proof is valid, decrypt E(k, d) using the shared secret key.

### Example solution:

Suppose that a doctor wishes to send a medical document containing a patient's age to a pharmacy, without revealing the patient's identity or any other personal information. The doctor encrypts the document using a secure symmetric encryption algorithm such as `AES-256`, with a randomly generated key `k`. The doctor then computes the hash value of the document, `H(d)`, which in this case would be the hash of the patient's age. The doctor also chooses a secret value `s`, and computes the commitment value `C` as:

```
C = g^r * (H(d))^s
```

where `g` is a small generator of a cyclic group, and `r` is a randomly generated value. The doctor sends the commitment value `C` and the encrypted document `E(k, d)` to the pharmacy.

The pharmacy receives the commitment value and the encrypted document, and chooses a random value `x`. The pharmacy sends `x` to the doctor, who computes the response value `y` as:

```
y = r + s*x
```

The doctor sends `y` to the pharmacy, which verifies the zero-knowledge proof by checking that:

```
g^y = C * (H(d))^x
```

If the proof is valid, the pharmacy can be sure that the doctor knows the patient's age, without learning any other personal information about the patient. The pharmacy can then decrypt the document using the shared secret key `k`, and use the patient's age to dispense the appropriate medication.
