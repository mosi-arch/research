## BTC L3 Proposal "BIP mosi"
*A programmed wallet to lock Bitcoin and generate a smart contract. Algorithm* (**L3-Proposal**):

### 1. Lock the Bitcoin: 
To create a Bitcoin smart contract, you can lock some Bitcoin in a wallet. This wallet can be programmed to only release the Bitcoin if certain conditions are met.

### 2. Generate the smart contract: 
Once the Bitcoin is locked in the wallet, you can use a programming language like Python to write a smart contract that specifies the conditions under which the Bitcoin will be released.

### 3. Test the smart contract: 
Before deploying the smart contract, you should test it to ensure that it functions as intended. This involves running simulations of various scenarios to ensure the contract executes correctly.

### 4. Deploy the smart contract: 
Once the smart contract has been tested, you can deploy it to the Bitcoin network. This involves creating a Bitcoin transaction that contains the bytecode and the necessary metadata. (Orbitals, Inscription)

### 5. Unlock the Bitcoin: 
When the conditions specified in the smart contract are met, the Bitcoin will be released from the wallet. (perhabsly taproot require)

### 6. Monitor the smart contract: 
Once the smart contract is deployed, you should monitor it to ensure that it's functioning correctly and that no unexpected behavior is occurring.

### 7. Update the smart contract: 
If necessary, you can update the smart contract to fix any bugs or to add new functionality. This involves modifying the smart contract code and deploying the updated version to the Bitcoin network. (re-deploy)

*This approach can be useful for creating Bitcoin smart contracts that are tied to specific Bitcoin addresses or wallets. It can also be used to create more complex smart contracts that involve multiple parties and conditions.*

- example code idea (fake/mock code, not use)
```py
# RPC BTC
# logic of rpc

# Lock some Bitcoin in a wallet
wallet_address = "the_wallet_address"
amount_to_lock = 0.1
txid = rpc_connection.sendtoaddress(wallet_address, amount_to_lock)

# Define the smart contract
def smart_contract():
    if condition:
        release_funds()
    else:
        refund_funds()

# Test the smart contract
test_condition = True
if test_condition:
    smart_contract()
else:
    refund_funds()

# Deploy the smart contract
deployed = False
if deployed:
    rpc_connection.sendrawtransaction(smart_contract_bytecode)
else:
    print("Smart contract not deployed")

# Monitor the smart contract
while True:
    if condition_met:
        release_funds()
        break

# Update the smart contract
def updated_smart_contract():
    if new_condition:
        release_funds()
    else:
        refund_funds()

# Interact with the smart contract
smart_contract()
```
